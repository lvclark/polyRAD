## Changes in v1.0 ##

Genotype likelihoods are now estimated under a beta-binomial distribution 
rather than the binomial distribution.  This change was made so that real
sequencing data would be accurately modeled; even in diploid heterozygotes,
read depth of two alleles is often very different from a 1:1 ratio, due to
many underlying issues with sequencing data that would be difficult to model.
Under the beta-binomial with respect to the binomial, there is an increased 
probability of read depth ratios that differ from the true allele copy 
ratio.  In a practical sense, this means reduced certainty in the estimation of
allele copy number from read depth alone, and an increased importance of 
genotype prior probabilities.  The exact shape of the beta-binomial 
distribution is determined by an overdispersion parameter, which the user can
optimize using the TestOverdispersion function.

The functions Export_polymapR, readTASSELGBSv2, RemoveHighDepthLoci,
AddGenotypePriorProb_Even, and TestOverdispersion have been added.

This version of polyRAD is incompatible with RADdata objects generated by
previous versions of polyRAD due to a change in format of the 
depthSamplingPermutations slot.  This slot was changed to simplify the
estimation of genotype likelihood.
