Description: Read depth data from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) or restriction 
  site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) are imported and used to make Bayesian
  probability estimates of genotypes in polyploids or diploids.  The genotype 
  probabilities, or genotypes sampled from those probabilties, can then be exported
  for downstream analysis.  'polyRAD' is described by Clark et al. (2018)
